# Project setup
First time project setup
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can check this by running `node -v`
2. Clone the project with SSH key(make sure that you have one set up): `git clone git@gitlab.liu.se:tddc88-2022/c1/company-1-project.git`
3. Install all dependencies `npm install`
4. Start the JSON server with mock data `npx json-server --watch data/db.json`
5. Start the development server `npm start`


Normal project setup
1. Get the latest version `git pull`
2. Install all dependencies `npm install`
3. Start the JSON server with mock data `npx json-server --watch data/db.json`
4. Start the development server `npm start`


Running mock API server for authentication
1. Do the normal project set up
2. Start the server on different terminal `npm run auth` 
3. The terminal with the server logs responses and statuses

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run auth`

Runs the mock server for authentication.\
Start it in a different terminal, if it reads "Running mock api json server" it is ready for use.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
